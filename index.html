			<p><b>HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO AN ENIGMA</b></p>
			<span>I suddenly lost adequate words to celebrate my Egbon today, because the thought of you and your person overwhelm me anytime, ever since that day I bumped into your private meeting two years ago, unannounced. I have met men of powers, I have seen men of great wealth, I have seen men who control and "run" things, I have interacted with men of valour, I have dined with royals, I have interacted with worthy leaders, I have seen "politicians and politrickians", BUT I am yet to see an S.O.B in them all.</br>
			Egbon,you are such a rare and special breed of human specie, a gift to Lagos state, Ikorodu and my generation. You have changed the traditional conceptions of what politics is in Ikorodu.S.O.B is eager and willing to serve his people in truth,indeed and in spirit.<b>OPO TO MU 'LE RO YI, KO NI WO LA </b> AGBARA AWON ALALE IKORODU.

			Like many others, we have been waiting eagerly to celebrate you on this your special day. On this day a child was born. Happy birthday sir, from me and my family.<br/><br/>

			<p>A man's past tells his journey but his present charts his future. Today i joined many others in celebrating the past of a person whose natural challenges would have condemned him to a life of mediocrity, yet his is a story of back to back successes. As much as i have always preferred the less popular and, most times, lonely path, i would have done myself great disservice by failing to add my heart-felt accolades to that of some many noble men and women who have felicitated with you, Hon. SOB Agunbiade as you celebrate your birthday.</p>

			<p><b>Alihamdulillah! Alihamdulillah!! Alihamdulillah!!!</b> 
			It's another time of the year to celebrate our own, the Opomulero of Ikorodu kingdom Hon. Sanai Bolanle Agunbiade SOB, the Majority Leader Lagos State House of Assembly. A great icon and exemplary leader, an orator, a political activist and a motivational speaker. Sir, as you are giving back to the society in your  little way, my believe is that givers never lack. May Allah swt continue to give you the strength, resources, energy and wisdom to continue the good work. Igba odun odunkan ni. Cheers.</p>

When you observe the numerous encomiums flooding in since days before the birthday of our Majority leader,Hon.

			<p>To Hon SOB Agunbiade,</p>
			<span>When the interest of a man is his community all the time, you will find him thinking, at all time, of how he can keep working for the good of his pple. Even his private happy moments would not be spared in the pursuit of common happiness for the majority. This is what SOB has displayed here and I can only pity those who find it difficult to rejoice with him on a day like this. He is blessed by men and God. He has redefined service to the electorate. He is giving new meaning to the business of touching lives...</span>

You have continuously show that no amount of resources used in furthering the cause of humanity can be too much and that, there is always reward for service. Your political leadership has been a blessing to many of us. You have reshaped my political thinking and illuminate my blurred vision with your practical teaching about dynamics of power, leadership and soul reawakening. Your philosophy, " what is it that God can do?" has been my guiding principles and brought me this far. Uncle Sanai, your dreams, vision and plans for Ikorodu is no doubt huge and would live beyond your physical presence but my oga, you shall live to fulfill all your heart desires for Ikorodu and humanity.  You shall live to fulfill all your destinies in life. May Ikorodu ancestors, our past heroes, the love of those living and the hope of those still coming guide, protect and give you the ability and capacity to take Ikorodu to the Promise land. May God crown your efforts.
